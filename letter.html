            <p>My Dearest Patutii,</p>
            <p>From the time i got to know you i can't say it was love at first sight but happiness.I got to enjoy your company not knowing i was growing fond of you everyday. My love for you gradually increased and will always do till forever. You have been a great blessing to me and there are a lot of things you've taught me and everytime i think of you i am greatful. As you continue to age graceful i pray that may the Lord Almighty increase you, defend and bless you in everything you do. I am happy to have you in my life and i will always be.I love you so much my Patutii💖💖💖.</p>
            <p>Forever Yours</p>
